<!--l. 219--><p class="noindent" >jTNC has been implemented to enable the development of Java applications
that support TNC and its most current bindings. Hereby, the goal of the
development was to create a software library that can be integrated into various
applications, which need TNC. Therefore, jTNC has a modular design, which
enables the addition of other bindings in the future (e.g. Tunneled EAP).
However, currently no further bindings have been added, which means the
addition of further bindings has to be tested and verified in the future.
Furthermore, because jTNC was developed for a prototype application,
the library is mostly tested for its functionality for now. This implies
that there need to be more tests such as limit tests for robustness and
interoperability tests with other TNC applications. However, for the functionality
tests an NAR and NAA have been developed as examples using different
self-implemented exemplary IMC and IMV types. The NAR was also involved
in a first interoperability test with the open source firewall strongSwan
