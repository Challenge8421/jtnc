<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >The module TNCCS contains the logic to control an integrity attestation. The
module can be used to implement either a TNCC or TNCS. Therefore, the
module is structured as depicted in Fig. <a 
href="#x10-90016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:tnccs_mod --></a>. The Client Facade provides an
interface for a surrounding application to interact with a TNCC or TNCS. To
execute an integrity attestation, the surrounding application has to create a
connection, using the module TRANSPORT, first. Than the application must
submit the connection to the Client Facade to embed the connection into a
Session. After its creation, this Session uses the Connection and the module
TRANSPORT for the transmission of messages as well as the module MESSAGE
to encode and decode such messages.
</p><!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >A State Machine with various States is used inside a Session to control an
integrity attestation. Therefor, every State implements a unique step of the
integrity attestation process and controls whether messages have to be received or
need to be transmitted for this step to be executed successfully. Messages, which
have been received in a receiving State, are passed to the Handlers that are
registered at the State Machine. An IF-TNCCS Message Handler can
process messages that are addressed to a TNCC or TNCS. If necessary the
handler may also create messages for transmission. Because a message to
a TNCC or TNCS may contain the result of an integrity attestation,
                                                                          

                                                                          
which is usually important for the surrounding application, the handler
is able to extract such information and forward it to the surrounding
application. On the contrary, the purpose of a Message Error Handler is not to
process messages but exceptions that may occur during the reception of
messages (e.g. exceptions concerning the message format or a value of a
message). This handler is able to create error messages as a response to
an exception for transmission to the origin of the faulty message. The
IF-M Message Handler is responsible for messages, which are addressed
to an IMC or IMV. The State Machine forwards these messages to this
handler, while the handler forwards them to the IMC or IMV, which are
known to it. Therefor, it is using Adapters. An Adapter controls an IMC or
IMV and negotiates the methods, which are supported by an IMC or
IMV (cf. section <a 
href="jTNCsu1.html#x5-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:imc --></a> and section <a 
href="jTNCsu2.html#x6-50003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:imv --></a>) to forward messages. The Adapter
may also be used to control the run-time an IMC or IMV is granted to
process a message after it was forwarded by the handler. The available
IMC and IMV, with their Adapters, are retrieved by the IF-M Message
Handler at the beginning of an integrity attestation from the IMC/V
Manager.
</p><!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >The IMC/V Manager is used by the Configuration Manager to initialize an IMC
or IMV after it was loaded and to make it available for an integrity attestation.
Therefor, the Configuration Manager is monitoring a configuration file
(tnc_config s. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="jTNCse7.html#XTCG13a">3</a>, pp. 75-77]</span> and <span class="cite">[<a 
href="jTNCse7.html#XTCG13b">4</a>, pp. 85-87]</span>) that is specified by the TNC-WG
to contain all IMC or IMV, which should be available for an integrity attestation.
If a new IMC or IMV entry is added to the configuration file, the Configuration
Manager will load the newly added IMC or IMV and request the IMC/V Manager
to initialize the newly loaded IMC or IMV. On the other hand, if an existing IMC
or IMV entry is removed, the Configuration Manager requests the IMC/V
                                                                          

                                                                          
Manager to terminate the corresponding IMC or IMV. For this to work,
an IMC or IMV has to support the methods, which are defined by the
TNC-WG and are contained in the modules IF-IMC API and IF-IMV
API.
